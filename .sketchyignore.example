# .sketchyignore - Example file
# This file tells sketchy to skip certain files/directories during scanning
# Similar to .gitignore format

Comments: Lines starting with #
Directory patterns: Patterns ending with / match entire directories
Glob patterns: Use * and ? wildcards
Negation: Use ! prefix to un-ignore files

# Skip entire directories
node_modules/
vendor/
dist/
build/
.venv/
__pycache__/

# Skip specific file patterns
*.log
*.min.js
*.min.css
*.map

# Skip test files (but you can override with negation)
test/
!test/test_security.py  # But scan this important test file

# Skip common build artifacts
*.o
*.so
*.dylib
*.dll
*.exe

# Skip package lock files (usually safe)
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
poetry.lock

# Skip documentation
docs/
*.md
!README.md  # But scan README files

# Skip temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
*.swp
*.bak







How it works:
File location: The scanner searches for .sketchyignore starting from the scan directory and walks up to the repository root (similar to .gitignore).

Pattern matching: Patterns are checked against file paths using glob matching.

Priority: Negation patterns (!) override ignore patterns.

Integration: Files matching ignore patterns are skipped before other checks.
