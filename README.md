## Why sketchy?

You know how it goes. You find a repo that probably solves your problem. It has decent docs, a few stars, last commit 8 months ago. You're about to `npm install` or `pip install` or just straight up `./install.sh` it.

**Your brain:** *"This is probably fine."*  
**Also your brain:** *"But remember that time PyTorch got supply chain attacked?"*  
**You:** *"That won't happen to me."*  
**Narrator:** *"It absolutely could"*

`sketchy` is a fast, cross-platform security scanner that checks for the obvious (and not-so-obvious) signs that a package, repo, or script might be trying to ruin your day. But you should read the fine print.

## Installation

### Pre-built binaries (for this tool?)
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -L https://github.com/adversis/sketchy/releases/latest/download/sketchy-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o sketchy
chmod +x sketchy
sudo mv sketchy /usr/local/bin/

# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/adversis/sketchy/releases/latest/download/sketchy-Windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "sketchy.exe"
```

### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adversis/sketchy
cd sketchy/go
go build -o sketchy .
```

Or check out and run the bash script
`bash/sketchy.sh`

## Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory
sketchy -path .

# Scan specific path
sketchy -path /path/to/repo

# Show only high-risk findings
sketchy -high-only -path /path/to/repo

# Show medium and high risk findings
sketchy -medium-up -path /path/to/repo

# Help
sketchy -help
```

## Output

```
🔍 Scanning: ./suspicious-repo
================================
HIGH RISK [GuardDog] Code execution pattern - code-execution
  File: main.py:42
  Preview: exec(open('payload.py').read())

HIGH RISK Cloud metadata endpoint access - cloud-metadata
  File: utils.py:128
  Preview: requests.get('http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/')

MEDIUM RISK Base64 decoding detected - base64
  File: config.py:15
  Preview: decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded_payload)

================================
Scan complete. Found 3 potential issue(s).
```

## Detections

- Command overwrites
- Code execution (exec, eval, etc.)
- Download and execute patterns
- Reverse shells
- Cryptocurrency miners
- Cloud metadata endpoint access
- Credential theft (SSH, AWS, browser cookies)
- Git credential harvesting
- Database credential access
- Base64 decoding
- Time-based triggers
- Dynamic imports
- WebSocket connections
- Persistence mechanisms (cron, systemd, LaunchAgents)
- Docker socket access
- Anti-debugging techniques
- VM detection
- URL string concatenation
- Hidden file operations
- Bidirectional Unicode characters (invisible code)
- Cyrillic characters (homograph attacks)
- Non-ASCII characters
- Dockerfile-specific risks
- GitHub Actions workflow risks
- Language-specific patterns (Python, JavaScript, etc.)

## Building for Different Platforms

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o sketchy .

# Build for Windows
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o sketchy.exe .

# Build for macOS ARM64
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o sketchy-darwin-arm64 .

# Build for Linux
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o sketchy-linux-amd64 .
```

## Exit Codes

The scanner returns the number of issues found as the exit code:
- `0`: No issues found
- `1+`: Number of issues detected

This makes it easy to use in CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
sketchy -path ./repo || echo "Found $? security issues"
```

## Fine print

- **License**: MIT
- **Warranty**: None. This is free software.
- **Attribution**: Detection patterns inspired by [DataDog's GuardDog](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog) (Apache 2.0)
- **Limitations**: Can't detect everything. Won't replace common sense. Some false positives. Some false negatives. Tool created slightly in jest. AI involved. YMMV.

## FAQ

**Q: Should I trust this tool?**  
A: You shouldn't trust anything, really. But the source is readable - audit it in 10 minutes.

**Q: It found malware, now what?**  
A: Delete it. Report it. Thank sketchy. Star this repo.

**Q: I found malware and sketchy didn't catch it.**  
A: Please report it! We're always improving detection patterns.

**Q: Is this paranoid?**  
A: npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and others keep finding malicious packages that lead to real breaches. Is it really paranoia if they're actually out to get you?
